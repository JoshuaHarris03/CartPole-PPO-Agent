# CartPole-PPO-Agent

This project demonstrates machine learning with reinforcement learning. It trains an agent to balance a cartpole using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from Stable Baselines3, a state-of-the-art RL library. It includes training, evaluation, and visualization of learning curves. This showcases advanced algorithms in AI.

You will need to install the dependencies in a virtual environment first.
